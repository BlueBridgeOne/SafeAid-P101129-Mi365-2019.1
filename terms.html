<h2>SAFEAID LLP GDPR POLICY</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>

        <p>This Policy sets out the obligations of Safeaid LLP ("Company") regarding data protection and the rights of
            its
            customers ("Data Subjects") in respect of their personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation
            ("Regulation").</p>

        <p>The Regulation defines "personal data" as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
            person (a
            data subject). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
            particular by
            reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or
            to
            one
            or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social
            identity
            of
            that natural person.</p>

        <p>This Policy sets out the procedures that are to be followed when dealing with personal data. The procedures
            and
            principles set out herein must be followed at all times by the Company and all parties working on behalf of
            the
            Company.</p>

        <p>The Company is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and places high
            importance on the correct, lawful, and fair handling of all personal data, respecting the legal rights,
            privacy,
            and
            trust of all individuals with whom it deals.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>The Data Protection Principles</h4>

        <p>This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the Regulation. The Regulation sets out the following principles
            with
            which any party handling personal data must comply. All personal data must be:
            <ol>
                <li>processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;</li>

                <li>collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner
                    that is
                    incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest,
                    scientific
                    or
                    historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with
                    the initial
                    purposes;</li>

                <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is
                    processed;
                </li>

                <li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that
                    personal
                    data
                    that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or
                    rectified without
                    delay;</li>

                <li>kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
                    purposes
                    for
                    which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the
                    personal
                    data
                    will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
                    research
                    purposes
                    or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational
                    measures
                    required
                    by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject; and</li>

                <li>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
                    against
                    unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
                    appropriate
                    technical
                    or organisational measures.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Lawful, Fair, and Transparent Data Processing</h4>

        <p>The Regulation seeks to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without
            adversely
            affecting the rights of the data subject. The Regulation states that processing of personal data shall be
            lawful
            if
            at least one of the following applies:
            <ol>
                <li>the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more
                    specific
                    purposes;
                </li>

                <li>processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or
                    in order to
                    take
                    steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;</li>

                <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
                </li>

                <li>processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
                    person;</li>

                <li>processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
                    exercise of
                    official authority vested in the controller;</li>

                <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or
                    by a third
                    party,
                    except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
                    subject which
                    require
                    protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>

                communicates
                with
                us).</li>

            <li>The Company only processes personal data for the specific purposes set out in Part 20 of this Policy or

        <p>Where any inaccurate or out-of-date data is found, all reasonable steps will be taken without delay to amend

            data or ensure that any such data is not readily accessible or useable by the Company, as appropriate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Timely Processing</h4>

        <p>The Company shall not keep personal data for any longer than is necessary in light of the purposes for which

            be
            taken
            to erase that data or amend it to ensure that any such data is not readily accessible or useable by the
            Company
            or
            its employees.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Secure Processing</h4>

                requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly where such requests are repetitive.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Rectification of Personal Data</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>If a data subject informs the Company that personal data held by the Company is inaccurate or
                incomplete,
                requesting that it be rectified, the personal data in question shall be rectified, and the data subject
                informed
                of
                that rectification, within one month of receipt the data subject's notice (this can be extended by up to
                two
                months
                in the case of complex requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for
                the
                extension).</li>

            <li>In the event that any affected personal data has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be
                informed of any rectification of that personal data.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Erasure of Personal Data</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Subjects may request that the Company erases the personal data it holds about them in the following
                circumstances:
                <ol>
                    <li>It is no longer necessary for the Company to hold that personal data with respect to the purpose
                        for
                        which it
                        was
                        originally collected or processed;</li>

                    <li>The data subject wishes to withdraw their consent to the Company holding and processing their
                        personal
                        data;
                    </li>

                    <li>The data subject objects to the Company holding and processing their personal data (and there is
                        no
                        overriding
                        legitimate interest to allow the Company to continue doing so) (see Part 17 of this Policy for
                        further
                        details
                        concerning Data Subjects' rights to object);</li>

                    <li>The personal data has been processed unlawfully;</li>

                    <li>The personal data needs to be erased in order for the Company to comply with a particular legal
                        obligation.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Unless the Company has reasonable grounds to refuse to erase personal data, all requests for erasure
                shall
                be
                complied with insofar as possible by the Company and the data subject informed of the action taken by
                the
                Company
                within one month of receipt of the data subject's request (this can be extended by up to two months in
                the case
                of
                complex requests, and in such cases the data subject shall be informed of the need for the extension).
            </li>

            <li>In the event that any personal data that is to be erased or made inaccessible to the Company in response
                to
                a
                data subject request has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of the action
                taken
                (unless it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort to do so).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Restriction of Personal Data Processing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Subjects may request that the Company ceases processing the personal data it holds about them. If a
                data
                subject makes such a request, the Company shall retain only the amount of personal data pertaining to
                that data
                subject that is necessary to ensure that no further processing of their personal data takes place.</li>

            <li>In the event that any affected personal data has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be
                informed of the applicable restrictions on processing it (unless it is impossible or would require
                disproportionate
                effort to do so).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Objections to Personal Data Processing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Subjects have the right to object to the Company processing their personal data based on legitimate
                interests.</li>

            <li>Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data based on its legitimate
                interests,
                the Company shall cease such processing forthwith, unless it can be demonstrated that the Company's
                legitimate
                grounds for such processing override the data subject's interests, rights and freedoms or the processing
                is
                necessary for the conduct of legal claims.</li>

            <li>Where a data subject objects to the Company processing their personal data for direct marketing
                purposes,
                the
                Company shall cease such processing forthwith.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Automated Decision-Making</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>If and when the Company uses personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making and those
                decisions
                have a legal (or similarly significant effect) on Data Subjects, Data Subjects have the right to
                challenge to
                such
                decisions under the Regulation, requesting human intervention, expressing their own point of view, and
                obtaining
                an
                explanation of the decision from the Company.</li>

            <li>The right described in Part 18.1 does not apply in the following circumstances:
                <ol>
                    <li>The decision is necessary for the entry into, or performance of, a contract between the Company
                        and the data
                        subject;</li>

                    <li>The decision is authorised by law; or</li>

                    <li>The data subject has given their explicit consent.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Profiling</h4>

        <p>If and when the Company uses personal data for profiling purposes, the following shall apply:
            <ol>
                <li>Clear information explaining the profiling will be provided, including its significance and the
                    likely
                    consequences;</li>

                <li>Appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures will be used;</li>

                <li>Technical and organisational measures necessary to minimise the risk of errors and to enable such
                    errors to be
                    easily corrected shall be implemented; and</li>

                <li>All personal data processed for profiling purposes shall be secured in order to prevent
                    discriminatory effects
                    arising out of profiling (see Parts 21 and 22 of this Policy for more details on data security).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Personal Data</h4>

        <p>The following personal data may be collected, held, and processed by the Company:
            <ol>
                <li>Addresses;</li>

                <li>Telephone and mobile numbers;</li>

                <li>Email addresses</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>and any such other personal data as the Company may reasonably require for it to provide its usual business
            services.
        </p>


    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Data Protection Measures</h4>

    <li>The Company shall ensure that all its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on its behalf
        comply
        with the following when working with personal data:
        <ol>
            <li>Where any personal data is to be erased or otherwise disposed of for any reason (including where copies
                have
                been
                made and are no longer needed), it should be securely deleted and disposed of. Hardcopies are securely
                disposed
                of
                via a confidential waste disposal company engaged by the Company and electronic copies should be deleted
                securely.
            </li>

            <li>No personal data may be shared informally and if an employee, agent, sub-contractor, or other party
                working on
                behalf of the Company requires access to any personal data that they do not already have access to, such
                access
                should be formally requested from Casper Smallridge.</li>

            <li>All hardcopies of personal data, along with any electronic copies stored on physical, removable media
                should
                be
                stored securely in a locked box, drawer, cabinet or similar;</li>

            <li>No personal data may be transferred to any employees, agents, contractors, or other parties, whether
                such
                parties
                are working on behalf of the Company or not, without the authorisation of Casper Smallridge;</li>

            <li>Personal data must be handled with care at all times and should not be left unattended or on view to
                unauthorised
                employees, agents, sub-contractors or other parties at any time;</li>

            <li>If personal data is being viewed on a computer screen and the computer in question is to be left
                unattended
                for any
                period of time, the user must lock the computer and screen before leaving it. In addition, the Company's
                computers
                are programmed to 'lock' and enter 'sleep' mode if left unattended for any more than a short period of
                time;
            </li>

            <li>No personal data should be transferred to any device personally belonging to an employee and personal
                data may
                only
                be transferred to devices belonging employees working on behalf of the Company where the party in
                question has
                agreed to comply fully with the letter and spirit of this Policy and of the Regulation (which may
                include
                demonstrating to the Company that all suitable technical and organisational measures have been taken);
            </li>

            <li>All personal data stored electronically should be backed up every day with backups stored offsite. All
                electronic
                copies of personal data should be stored securely using passwords;</li>

            <li>All passwords used to protect personal data are changed regularly and do not use words or phrases that
                can be
                easily guessed or otherwise compromised; and</li>

            <li>Under no circumstances are any passwords shared between any employees, agents, contractors, or other
                parties
                working on behalf of the Company, irrespective of seniority or department.</li>

    </li>
</ol>

                Policy, and shall be provided with a copy of this Policy;</li>

            <li>Only employees, agents, sub-contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company that need
                access
                to, and
                use of, personal data in order to carry out their assigned duties correctly shall have access to
                personal data
                held
                by the Company;</li>

            <li>All employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company handling personal

            <li>Methods of collecting, holding and processing personal data shall be regularly evaluated and reviewed;
            </li>

            <li>The performance of those employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the
                Company
                handling
                personal data shall be regularly evaluated and reviewed;</li>

            <li>All employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company handling personal
                data
                will
                be bound to do so in accordance with the principles of the Regulation and this Policy by contract;</li>

            <li>All agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company handling personal data must
                ensure
                that

                as those relevant employees of the Company arising out of this Policy and the Regulation; and</li>

                costs,
                liability,
                damages, loss, claims or proceedings which may arise out of that failure.</li>

    <h4>Data Breach Notification</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>All personal data breaches must be reported immediately to the Company's data protection officer.</li>

        <li>If a personal data breach occurs and that breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
            of
            Data Subjects (e.g. financial loss, breach of confidentiality, discrimination, reputational damage, or other
            significant social or economic damage), the data protection officer must ensure that the Information
            Commissioner's
            Office is informed of the breach without delay, and in any event, within 72 hours after having become aware
            of
            it.
        </li>

        <li>In the event that a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk (that is, a higher risk than
            that
            described under Part 23.2) to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects, the data protection officer must
            ensure
            that
            all affected Data Subjects are informed of the breach directly and without undue delay.</li>

        <li>Data breach notifications shall include the following information:

                    information can be obtained);</li>

                <li>The likely consequences of the breach; and</li>

                <li>Details of the measures taken, or proposed to be taken, by the Company to address the breach
                    including, where
                    appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.</li>
            </ol>
